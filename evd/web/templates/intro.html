                        Starting with a Summer camp in Thenur village, partnering with <a href="http://www.payri.org/">Payir Trust</a> in May 2010, over the past year we have our presence in 5 Villages, 3 states & 3 Languages. Our Pilot phase covers approx. 100 children, across Rural India studying in Government school for classes 6th to 8th.

                <div class="sub-menu">
                    <p>There have been systemic investments by the State in the areas of Infrastructure and enrollment in Schools. However the desired quality of learning by the children has been consistently below threshold levels leading to Gap in Education. This has been reiterated by the surveys being done nationally by Pratham who carries out this activity for past few years.</p>
