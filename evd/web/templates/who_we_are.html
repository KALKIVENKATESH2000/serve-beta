                             oka since its inception in all its activities. I have always looked upon the founders as my inspiration to do something not just for monetary c                             ause. After I felt that my kids are less dependent on me I began to think if I'm capable of doing something else on a positive note. I signed u                             p one fine morning into eVidyaloka after confirming that I need not teach or develop lesson plans, which have never been my force.
                            I love organizing and managing things and hence made an entry into eVidyaloka as one of its Admin with a pinch of fear. I am a perfectionist and love challenges. I strive to face them and succeed too. Thus began my journey 2 years ago and this is my life now. I'm possessed about my center, the children there and the team that runs with me. We see our own world at the center .I don't imagine a day without eVidyaloka which has fulfilled my passion for talking. I don't describe my role                             at eVidyaloka as something driven by passion or for the sake of service or something to give back to the society but it is my strong feeling that eveiry child deserves the same platform of learning and not deprived of the exposure just because they belong to the rural set up.</p>
