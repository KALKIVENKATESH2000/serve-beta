    <p>Dear {{ user }},</p>
    <p>Please find below the details to help you prepare for your sessions.</p>
    <p><b>Background of the Students:</b></p>
    <p>The students are from government schools in remote villages, they lack the infrastructure and manpower -
     the teachers. </p>
     <p>Therefore, it is recommended that you understand the knowledge level of the students before you proceed with the syllabus. </p>
     <p>A brief revision of the basics will also help you to build a rapport with the students, enhance their confidence and motivate them to learn more.</p>
    <p>Example: A 6th standard student may need to be taught basics of multiplication,
     students in 8th may need to be taught how to construct basic sentences etc. 
   You may know more about the various tools to teach, syllabus,
    the volunteer community and tasks by clicking the below buttons.</p>

   <b>Suggestions to prepare for first two classes:</b>
   <p>
   1. Show the children where they are located (school) and where you are located (your city) via Google Maps, using Screen Share on Skype.<br>
   2. Tell them about yourself (the students love hearing stories about their teachers, their experiences in school, their current job, their qualification, how much they've studied to reach their current position).<br>
   3. Ask them about their hobbies, the games they like to play, and what’d want to become when they are older etc.<br>
   4. Any playful/moral story's cartoon video in the local language.<br>
   5. Story Telling: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B4m07xnDF8JpfnVCanV0T1JSNHRnWFdFT0J2YndDZ2o0VUtLQmhpM1ByQVJtZXFoWFVFNzA?usp=sharing
